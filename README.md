# 3D Platform made with COCOS CREATOR for a specific client

This project was a web focus and made using Cocos Creator Engine.

My participation was on the creation of that platform, the conection between platform and API, adding some 3D models and adjusting light, sounds and so on.
My idea for the code was a simple code that could be used as a behavior for any planet present on the platform. So if there is a necessity of adding more, it will be very ease even today.
